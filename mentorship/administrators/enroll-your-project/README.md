# Enroll Your Project

Enrolled mentorship projects are reviewed by The Linux Foundation before they're published and visible on the Mentorship platform. Projects are reviewed based on the following factors: 

* Open source status - projects must be 100% open source 
* Community-wide adoption
* Alignment with The Linux Foundationâ€™s support of open source initiative

* A logo file in JPG, PNG, or SVG format that identifies your project.
