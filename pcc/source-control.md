# Source Control

Source Control allows you to track and manage updates to your code. It gives you the control to manage the right version of the code. PCC allows your to setup Source Control to your projects.

For compliance reasons, the Linux Foundation platform needs to have access to each GitHub organization you use to host your code. Your governance body and authorized community members will still be responsible and accountable for day-to-day administration of repositories, teams, and users, unless covered by a specific managed-services-agreement with the Linux Foundation.

You can setup the following Source Controls tools to your projects:

Your project should have its own GitHub organization, separate from your company's GitHub organization, and which is not shared with other, non-Linux-Foundation projects. If you need to, create a new GitHub organization for this project, and have a user who is an owner in both organizations transfer each project repository to this organization.

Then, invite the user “thelinuxfoundation” as an owner at the organization level (not per repository) to the GitHub organization, and connect them in Project Control Center.
