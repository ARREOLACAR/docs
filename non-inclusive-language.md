# Non Inclusive Language

LFX Security in collaboration with BluBracket scans for non inclusive language. Non inclusive language that depict people unfairly in an insulting manner and exclude people based on their ethnicity, gender or color. Usage of these words or language is not expected use in the open source code.

LFX Security will scan for the non inclusive language which might have been added by the developers unintentionally without their knowledge. Some of the generic non inclusive words that are used in the code are blacklist, whitelist, slave, master.
