After the application is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up an individual Expensify account for each beneficiary. Then, each beneficiary receives an email from the finance team with a notification that includes a link to their Expensify account.

The finance team also works with you to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the Travel Fund. All the beneficiary and fund expenses are controlled through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for beneficiaries or a per diem food allowance.

Only you \(the person who submitted this application\) can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.
