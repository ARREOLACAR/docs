# Log In With GitHub

A _social login_ is single sign-on for end users. You can use your existing login credentials from GitHub \(social network provider\) to log in to CommunityBridge rather than creating a CommunityBridge account. During your initial login, you enter your GitHub credentials to authenticate your GitHub account. Subsequent logins do not require you to enter your credentials⏤you simply click **Login with GitHub**. This one-click approach simplifies your logins.

## Initial Login

1. Go to [communitybridge.org](https://communitybridge.org/) and click **Log me in**.

   The Login to LFX form appears:
