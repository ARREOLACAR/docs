## Create an account <a id="create-an-account"></a>

If you are logging in for the first time to any Linux Foundation managed service that is protected with Single Sign On,  you must create an account. To create a Linux Foundation SSO account, do the following:

1. For services like Events Registration, JIRA, Confluence, Training and Certification, etc, clicking on the service URL itself will present the Sign In page.
2.  For services like CommunityBridge funding, you may be presented a "Login" or "Sign In" link when trying to apply or donate. Clicking on that link will again present the same Sign In page.
3. Click **Create Account**.
