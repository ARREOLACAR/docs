# Sign in to Your Account

To access protected Linux Foundation tools, you must sign in using your LF SSO account. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation account formerly known as LFID, you can use it. If you just [created a brand new account](../create-an-account.md), please proceed as follows.

1\. On the **Sign In** window, enter your SSO account credentials and click **SIGN IN**.

2\. The Single Sign-On service allows users to authenticate with social and 3rd party authentication providers instead of a username and password.

3\. When using a 3rd party authentication provider, you may be prompted to create a username if you don't have an existing username.&#x20;

4\. If you create your LF account by signing in with 3rd party authentication provider, the Linux Foundation will map your LF Account to the 3rd party login.
