# Sign in to your Account

To access protected Linux Foundation services, you must sign in using your LF account. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation account formerly known as LFID please can use it. If you just [created a brand new account](../create-an-account.md), please proceed as follows. 

1. On the **Sign In** window, enter your LF Account credentials and click on **Sign In** CTA button.

2. The Single Sign-On service allows users to authenticate with social and 3rd party authentication providers instead of a username and password.

3. When using a 3rd party authentication provider, you may be prompted to create a username if you don't have an existing username. 

4. If you create your LF account by signing in with 3rd party authentication provider, the Linux Foundation will map your LF Account to the 3rd party login.
