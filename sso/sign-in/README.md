# Sign in to your Account

To access protected Linux Foundation services, you will need to sign in using your SSO account.  If you just [created a brand new account](../create-an-account.md), please proceed as follows. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation account formerly known as LFID, you can simply re-use that.

1. On the **Sign In** window, enter your SSO account credentials and click **Sign in**   ![Create Account](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-04-at-7.26.09-pm.png)
2. The Single Sign-On service permits the use of social and 3rd party authentication providers instead of a username. 
3. The tradeoff between creating an account vs. using a 3rd party authentication provider is between ease of use and control. While you can choose your own _Username_ when creating a SSO account, using a 3rd party provider auto-generates a system designated _Username_
