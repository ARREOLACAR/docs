# Sign in to your Account

To access protected Linux Foundation services, you will need to sign in using your SSO account. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation account also known as LFID, you can simple re-use that. If you just [created a brand new account](../create-an-account.md), please proceed as follows: 

1. On the **Sign In** window, enter your SSO account credentials and click **Sign in**.
