# Sign in to your Account

To access protected Linux Foundation services, you will need to sign in using your SSO account.  If you just [created a brand new account](../create-an-account.md), please proceed as follows. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation account formerly known as LFID, you can simply re-use that.

1. On the **Sign In** window, enter your SSO account credentials and click **Sign in**   ![Create Account](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-04-at-7.26.09-pm.png)
2. The Single Sign-On service permits the use of social and 3rd party authentication providers instead of a username. 
3. When using a 3rd party authentication provider, you may be prompted to create a Username if you do not already have an existing new/legacy Username. 
4. In case you have created an SSO account earlier., signing in with 3rd party auth providers, with the exception of Google, will not prompt you again to create an username. It will simply map your SSO account to the social/3rd party login.
