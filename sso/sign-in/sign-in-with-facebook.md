# Sign in with Facebook

You can use your Facebook login credentials to sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an LF account. The first time you sign in, you will enter your Facebook credentials to authenticate your Facebook account. Subsequent logins will not require you to enter the credentials‚è§you will simply click the **Facebook** icon to sign in. This one-click approach simplifies your login process.

3. If you have an existing Linux Foundation SSO account, Linux Foundation maps your SSO account to the social/3rd party login, and you can access the protected Linux Foundation service. If you do not have an SSO account created earlier, then the **Create an account** page appears.
