# Sign in with Facebook

You can use your Facebook login credentials to Sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an SSO account. The first time you sign in, you would enter your Facebook credentials to authenticate your Facebook account. Subsequent logins would not require you to enter your credentials‚è§you simply click the **Facebook** icon to sign in_**.**_ This one-click approach simplifies your logins.

## To Sign in with Facebook: <a id="to-log-in-with-facebook"></a>

1. On the **SSO page**, click the Facebook icon to continue to Sign in with Facebook.

3. If you have an existing Linux Foundation SSO account, Linux Foundation maps your SSO account to the social/3rd party login, and you can access the protected Linux Foundation service. If you do not have an SSO account created earlier, then the **Create an account** page appears.
