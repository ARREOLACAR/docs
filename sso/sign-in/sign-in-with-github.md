# Sign in with GitHub

You can use your login credentials from GitHub to Sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating a SSO account. The first time you sign in, you would enter your GitHub credentials to authenticate your GitHub account. Subsequent logins would not require you to enter your credentials‚è§you simply click the **GitHub** icon to sign in. This one-click approach simplifies your logins.

2. The Sign in to GitHub page appears.                          ![Create Account](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-04-at-7.21.17-pm.png)
3. Enter your GitHub user credentials and click **Sign in**. You may be presented a screen to provide your authentication code, if your account has Two-factor authentication turned on. Based on your choice of delivery mechanism, you may receive this code via SMS, email or text on your device.                                                       ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-05-at-2.29.08-am.png) 
4. Thats it! Upon verifying your code, you should be able to access the protected Linux Foundation service. This is usually the case if you already have a new or existing Linux Foundation SSO account. We simply map your SSO account to the social/3rd party login.
5. If you did not have an SSO account created earlier, then the **Create an account** page appears.                                                                          ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-05-at-2.27.26-am.png)
6. Enter a username, and click **Create Account**.  **Note:** This username will be your new SSO Account Username, and will be synced with your email address.
7. You will be then directed to the protected service that you are trying to access.
