# Sign in with Google

You can use your login credentials from Google \(gmail\) to Sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating a SSO account. Signing up with your Google account will auto generate the Linux Foundation SSO account for you.

The first time you sign in, you would enter your Google credentials to authenticate your Google account. Subsequent logins would not require you to enter your credentials⏤you simply click **Login with Google**. This one-click approach simplifies your logins.
