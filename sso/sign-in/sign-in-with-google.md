# Sign in with Google

You can use your login credentials from Google \(gmail\) to Sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating a SSO account. The first time you sign in, you would enter your Google credentials to authenticate your Google account. Subsequent logins would not require you to enter your credentials‚è§you simply click the **Google** icon to sign in.. This one-click approach simplifies your logins.
