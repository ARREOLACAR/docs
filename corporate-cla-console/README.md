# Corporate CLA Console

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The EasyCLA Corporate Console is meant to be used by CLA Managers of companies to coordinate the CCLA signing process and to manage their company's list of authorized contributors. Individuals who are not managing a CCLA for their company cannot access the EasyCLA Corporate Console.
{% endhint %}

The EasyCLA Corporate Console makes it easier for companies to sign Corporate Contributor License Agreements \(CLAs\) for projects, view CLA details, and manage their lists of authorized contributors. After a CLA Manager signs in to the [EasyCLA Corporate Console](https://organization.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard), they can view the following sections:

* [Dashboard](dashboard.md)
* [Manage Organization](manage-organization.md)
* [Projects](projects/)

The EasyCLA Corporate Console is used by CLA Managers. For more information about the different user roles in EasyCLA, see [What Role are You?](../easycla/getting-started/#what-role-are-you)
