# Enable or Disable Scanning for a Repository

From Settings tab, you can perform the following tasks:

* Enable or disable vulnerability and code secret scanning for a repository to refine scanning report of the project.
* Auto enabling repositories for scanning vulnerabilities.

## **Enable/Disable a Repository for Vulnerability Scan**

You can enable or disable a repository for vulnerability scanning in the Settings tab. If you enable a repository for vulnerability scanning, the repository is scanned for the vulnerabilities. If you disable the vulnerability scanning for a repository, the scanning will be skipped for the selected repository and vulnerabilities are not detected. &#x20;

To enable or disable a repository for vulnerability scan, perform the following steps:

1.Select **Settings **from the menu and click **Vulnerabilities**.\
All repositories of the project are listed in alphabetical order.&#x20;

3\. Under **Last** **Scan Results **tab, you can see whether the repository scan has been successful or where there were any errors while scanning the repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
The error details for the repository is displayed when you click the ![](../.gitbook/assets/Error.png) icon.&#x20;
