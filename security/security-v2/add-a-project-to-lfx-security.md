# Add a Project to LFX Security

LFX Security hosts open source projects that show security vulnerability information in the Vulnerability Report.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
When a project is hosted on the LFX Security, only Project maintainers and contributors can access LFX Security scan details.
{% endhint %}

If your project is not hosted on LFX Security, you can submit a project application.

**To submit a project:**

1. [Log in](../../sso/sign-in/) to [LFX Security](https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org).&#x20;
2. Click **Secure My Project**, you will be redirected to PCC. You have to onboard the project from PCC. Refer [Onboarding your Project section](onboarding-your-project.md)  for more information.&#x20;
