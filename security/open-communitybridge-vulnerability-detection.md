# Open LFX Vulnerability Detection

Vulnerability Detection detects vulnerabilities in LFX projects. Projects that are part of the LFX receive free daily scans via the Vulnerability Detection service in order to detect vulnerabilities in code repositories as well as library dependencies. LFX projects include a Vulnerability Report, which gives an overview of vulnerability severities. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only project maintainers can access Vulnerability Detection details to gain visibility into open security issues and paths to remediation.
{% endhint %}

As a project maintainer, you can access vulnerability scan details for projects based on the LFX service you opted while enrolling your project:

* [Projects applied to LFX Funding](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#projects-applied-to-lfx-funding)
* [Projects applied to LFX Vulnerability Detection](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#projects-applied-to-lfx-vulnerability-detection)

**Note:** If you are not a project maintainer and/or not authorized to see vulnerability report for a project, you can [request access](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#requesting-access-to-view-vulnerability-report) to see vulnerability scan details.
