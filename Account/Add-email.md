# Set Another Email Address as Primary?

When you sign up to the CommunityBridge, you are asked to provide an email address that is used as the primary source of communication. However, you can associate multiple email addresses with your account.  Any authentication you do that uses one of these email addresses is automatically linked to your account. 

## To Add Another Email Address
Do the following to another email address:
1. On the Account Settings page, click **Add Email**. ![Add another email](/imgs/Add_email.png)
