# Individual Dashboard \(MyProfile\)

Individual Dashboard \(MyProfile\) is a self-service dashboard where you can edit your contact information, change your password, keep track of your emails and community identities, and much more. We are providing early access to the Individual Dashboard \(MyProfile\) in order to provide the community with an initial look at their profiles across LF services. We will be continuing to update the dashboard to provide users with greater visibility into—and control over—their personal information.
