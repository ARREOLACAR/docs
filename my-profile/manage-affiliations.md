# Manage Affiliations

### Overview

Affiliation is the act of associating with an organization on behalf of which you contribute to The Linux Foundationâ€™s projects. The Affiliations section shows statistical dashboards for communities, and provides a complete visibility into affiliations.

The section displays the following details based on data availability:

* The names of the projects you're contributing to
* Your level of contribution, such as contributor or maintainer
* Time duration for each contribution
* Affiliation type, such as Individual or the names of the organizations you're affiliated with as a contributor or maintainer.
* Manage Affiliations CTA to manage your affiliations

### **What can you do?**

If your affiliation details, such as company name, affiliation time period, contribution level (contributor or maintainer), and so on are not correctly displayed, you can anytime edit, update or delete your affiliation with an organization.
