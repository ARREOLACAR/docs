# Corporate Contributor

As a corporate \(employee\) contributor, you are contributing code on company's behalf. When Corporate CLA is signed for the project, you confirm your association with the company during your first pull request or change submit. Your subsequent contributions will neither require association confirmations nor will they be gated by CLA check.

* [GitHub](corporate-contributor.md#github)
* Gerrit

## GitHub

1. In GitHub, go to the repository that is linked to the project for your organization.

2. Make a change and send a pull request.

{% hint style="info" %}
* EasyCLA checks your CLA status. It marks a cross or a tick beside your name based on your CLA status.
* A cross next to your contributor name means the CLA check failed.
