# Sign a CLA as an Individual Contributor to GitHub

As an individual contributor, you are contributing code on your own behalf \(and not on behalf of an employer\), you create a pull request in GitHub to inform code maintainers about changes made to the code. During the pull request process, your CLA is verified. Also during the process, you click a link to open the CLA Contributor Console to sign the CLA.

**To Sign CLA:**

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository that is linked to the project for your organization.

2. Make a change and send a pull request.

{% hint style="info" %}
* EasyCLA checks your CLA status. It marks a cross or a tick beside your name based on your CLA status.
* A cross next to your contributor name means the CLA check failed.
{% endhint %}
