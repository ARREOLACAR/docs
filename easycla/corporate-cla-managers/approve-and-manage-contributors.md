# Approve and Manage Contributors

You can approve contributors by adding them to the Approved List so that they can contribute to the project under a signed corporate CLA. **Approved Lists** are lists of domain names, email addresses of individuals, GitHub usernames, or GitHub organization names that allow contributors to be authorized to contribute under a signed corporate CLA.

* [Add Contributors](approve-and-manage-contributors.md#add-contributor-s)

* [Delete a Contributor](approve-and-manage-contributors.md#delete-a-contributors-details)
