# EasyCLA

EasyCLA streamlines the management and execution of [Contributor License Agreements \(CLAs\)](getting-started/#what-is-a-cla), to help projects ensure that contributions are made in accordance with project policies. It is the only CLA management tool to correctly support both individual and corporate CLA workflows in an automated environment.

## What is LFX EasyCLA? <a id="what-is-easycla"></a>

_LFX EasyCLA_ helps streamline the contribution process for open source projects that use Contributor License Agreements \(CLAs\), by streamlining workflows for project maintainers, contributors, and organizations whose employees are contributing to the project. EasyCLA coordinates the process of getting CLAs signed and, for companies and other organizations, the process of authorizing employees to contribute under a signed CLA. By automating many of the manual processes, this open source solution hosted by The Linux Foundation reduces delays for developers to get authorized under a CLA.

## Different Consoles of EasyCLA:

* [EasyCLA Project Console](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) for a project's director or manager \(typically an LF staff member\) to oversee the project's CLA setup. It is sometimes referred as the LFX Project Control Center in this documentation.
* [EasyCLA Contributor Console](https://github.com/communitybridge/easycla-contributor-console) for a contributor to a project to sign an Individual CLA \(ICLA\), or to kick off the corporate CLA \(CCLA\) signature process.
* [EasyCLA Corporate Console](https://organization.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) for a company's CLA Manager to coordinate the corporate CLA signature process, and then to manage their company's authorized contributors.
