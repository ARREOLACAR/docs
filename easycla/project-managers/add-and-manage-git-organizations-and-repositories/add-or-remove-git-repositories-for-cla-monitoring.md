### Configure Gerrit Repositories

After you[ add a Gerrit organization](./#add-gerrit-organization), by default all its repositories are CLA enabled. You cannot disable CLA for an individual gerrit repository. However, you can [disassociate gerrit organization](./#disassociate-gerrit-organization) to disable CLA for the organization and all its repositories.
