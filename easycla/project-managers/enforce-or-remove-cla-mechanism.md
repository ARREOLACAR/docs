# Enforce or Remove CLA Mechanism

Before you enable Git repositories for CLA check or remove them from CLA mechanism, you must add the Git organizationsâ€” add [GitHub](add-and-manage-github-organizations.md) or [Gerrit](add-and-manage-gerrit-organizations.md) or [GitLab](add-and-manage-gitlab-groups.md) organizations. You can perform the following activities with EasyCLA:

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md) to the [Project Control Center](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/).
2. Click a **project** of interest.
3. Scroll down to **Tools Status** section, and click **EasyCLA**.

## Enforce or Remove CLA Mechanism from GitHub Repositories

1. Under GitHub, select the added organization for which you want to manage repositories.

## Enforce CLA Mechanism for Gerrit Repositories

After you add a [Gerrit organization](add-and-manage-gerrit-organizations.md), by default all of its repositories are CLA enabled. You cannot disable CLA for an individual Gerrit repository. However, you can [disassociate the Gerrit organization](add-and-manage-gerrit-organizations.md#disassociate-gerrit-organization) to disable CLA for the organization and all of its repositories.
