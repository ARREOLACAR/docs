# Update Templates

Project managers can edit and update CLA templates to display the correct email address of the person managing the project so that contributors can submit signed CLAs to the mentioned email addresses if they want to sign them manually, rather than via DocuSign.

1. Sign in to the [Project Control Center](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/).
2. Under My Projects, click a project, and scroll down to **Tools Status** section, and click  **EasyCLA**.
3. Under CLA Groups, select a CLA group for which you want to update templates.
4. Navigate to **TEMPLATES** tab, and click **Edit Template**.
5. Provide email address of the person managing the project in the respective field, and click **Update Template**.  **Note:** This email address is displayed in the CLA templates as the email address for contributors to submit signed CLAs if they want to sign them manually, rather than via DocuSign.
6. Click **Update Template**.
