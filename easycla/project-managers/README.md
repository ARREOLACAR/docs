# Project Managers

Project managers manage project details, such as GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, repositories, and legal aspects. The Linux Foundation provides project managers administrator access to projects through the Project Control Center \(PCC\) —also known as Project Console— to manage projects.

As a project administrator, you do the following activities:

1. [Sign in to Project Control Center](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md)
2. [Create New CLA Group](create-new-cla-group.md)
3. [Add GitHub organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-github-organization) or [Gerrit organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-gerrit-organization)
4. [Enforce CLA monitoring for GitHub repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring-from-github-repositories) or [Gerrit repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-cla-monitoring-for-gerrit-repositories)

Additionally, you can anytime view and manage CLA details, Git organizations and repositories:

1. [View and Manage CLA Group Details](view-and-manage-cla-group-details.md)
2. [Add or Remove Project from CLA Group](add-or-remove-a-project-from-cla-group.md)
3. [View connection status of Git organizations and repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/view-connection-status-of-git-organizations-and-repositories.md)
4. [Disassociate GitHub organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#disassociate-github-organization)
5. [Disassociate Gerrit organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#disassociate-gerrit-organization)
6. [Remove CLA Monitoring from GitHub repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring-from-github-repositories)
7. [Uninstall the EasyCLA Application from git organization](uninstall-the-easycla-application.md)
