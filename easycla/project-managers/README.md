# Project Managers

Project managers manage project details, such as GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, repositories, and legal aspects, such as EasyCLA for the assigned projects. The Linux Foundation provides you administrator access for projects, and you use the Project Control Center \(PCC\), also referred as Project Console, to manage projects.

As a project administrator, you do the following activities:

1. [Sign in to Project Control Center](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md)
2. [Create New CLA Group](create-new-cla-group.md)
3. [View and Manage CLA Group Details](view-and-manage-cla-group-details.md)
4. [Add or Remove Project from CLA Group](add-or-remove-a-project-from-cla-group.md)
5. [Add](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-github-organization) or [Disassociate](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#disassociate-github-organization) GitHub Organization
