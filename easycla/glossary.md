Typically, the intellectual property is software under an open source license. It is a legal contract signed by contributors before they can contribute code to a project.

#### **CCLA**

A CLA template is a document that contains terms and conditions under which contributors contribute code. The Linux Foundation provides an apache style CLA template that is generated after project managers provide project details while creating a CLA group, and contains information such as project name, project full entity name, and contact address. Project Managers use this template under a CLA group to let contributors sign before they can contribute code.

#### **CLA Group**

A CLA group defines CLA details, such as CLA types \(ICLA and/or CCLA\) a project requires for pull requests or push submissions, GitHub repositories and/or Gerrit instances that are CLA enforced, and projects under a foundation that are CLA enabled. One CLA group is used under a unique [CLA template](glossary.md#cla-template).

#### **ICLA**

Individual Contributor License Agreement \(ICLA\) defines terms and conditions under which individuals contribute code on behalf of their own.

[A CLA Manager Designee](corporate-cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/) is authorized by the company to sign CLA, when there are no existing CLA managers for a company. CLA Manager designees use the company dashboard to sign CLA, and during the process, they can sign the CLA, or can designate someone else as CLA signatory to sign CLA on behalf of the company. After CLA is signed, a CLA manager designee becomes a CLA manager.
