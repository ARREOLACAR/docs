# CCLA Signatories

A corporate CLA signatory or CCLA signatory is someone who is authorized to sign a CCLA on behalf of their company.

If the CCLA signatory is the same person as the initial CLA Manager, then they will sign the CCLA themselves while [coordinating the CCLA signing process](broken-reference).

Otherwise, if the CCLA signatory is a different person than the initial CLA Manager, then the CCLA signatory will receive an email informing them that they are designated to be an authorized signatory for a company. The CCLA signatory can [review and sign the CCLA](broken-reference) on behalf of the company.
