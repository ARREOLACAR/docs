## EasyCLA

EasyCLA helps maintainers of open source projects streamline their workflows and reduce the hassle of managing Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) and authorizing contributors. By automating many of the manual processes, this open source solution hosted by the Linux Foundation reduces delays for developers to get authorized under a CLA. You can find more information about EasyCLA [here](https://github.com/communitybridge/easycla/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
