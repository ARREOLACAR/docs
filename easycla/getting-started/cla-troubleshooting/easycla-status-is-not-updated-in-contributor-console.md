# EasyCLA Status is not Updated in Contributor Console

When corporate contributors are added to the approved list or they complete CLA signing process, the CLA status still remains **Not Covered** for GitHub, and shows **No Contributor Agreement** for Gerrit while submitting change.

#### Solutions:

#### For GitHub

After you are added to approved list, you [must acknowledge company contribution](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#acknowledge-company-contribution) or [sign ICLA](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#if-you-are-asked-to-sign-icla) if your CLA requires you to sign individual CLA for getting full authorization to contribute.

#### For Gerrit

Navigate to Gerrit window, sign out and sign in again, and then submit a change.
