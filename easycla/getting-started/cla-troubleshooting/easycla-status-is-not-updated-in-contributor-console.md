# EasyCLA Status is not Updated in Contributor Console

When contributors are added to the approved list or complete CLA signing process when they are gated and navigated from GitHub or Gerrit consoles, the CLA status still remain **Not Covered** for GitHub, and **No Contributor Agreement** for Gerrit while submitting change.

#### Solutions:

#### For GitHub

After you are added to approved list, you [must acknowledge company contribution](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#acknowledge-company-contribution) or [sign ICLA](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#if-you-are-asked-to-sign-icla) if your CLA requires you to sign for getting full authorization to contribute.

#### For Gerrit

Navigate to Gerrit window, sign out and sign in again, and then submit a change.
