# EasyCLA FAQs

**Who do I contact to enable my Linux Foundation-hosted project to use EasyCLA?**

Open [https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/4/create/143](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/4/create/143), submit the form describing your requirements, and import your existing CLAs.

**Why does The Linux Foundation ask contributors of some projects to sign CLAs?**

Some project communities have elected to use CLAs as a required step for contributions to their code. For those that have, the Linux Foundation wants to ensure that contributions comply with the IP policies of that project, including ensuring that contributors have accepted the corresponding CLA.

**What is the difference between Corporate CLA and Individual CLA?**

A Corporate CLA needs to be in place if you are contributing code on behalf of your employer. A Corporate CLA should be signed by an individual who is authorized to enter into it on behalf of the company. After the Corporate CLA is signed, your email address needs to be included in an approved list that is associated with your employer for this project. A CCLA manager for your company is responsible for managing the approved lists.

An Individual CLA is signed by an individual for contributions that they contribute on their own behalf, as opposed to contributions on behalf of their employer or another entity.

#### What is Signing Entity? Should I always select a signing entity?

Signing Entity is organization's legal entity which is authorized by the organization to sign a corporate CLA. Yes, you must select a signing entity under your organization.

#### What if there is no signing entity available for my organization?

Every company has a legal signing entity. If you don't see a signing entity name under your organization, you must provide the signing entity name by navigating to [create new organization window](../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#if-the-select-company-dialog-appears-1).

**Which Corporate CLA approval criteria option has the lowest maintenance overhead?**

The **Approval Criteria** option requires less overhead for CCLA signatories and CCLA managers because it allows entities to contribute under any email address under that domain name. When CCLA signatories and CCLA managers use the Email Approval Criteria instead of the Domain Approval Criteria, they must  add email address of the contributor every time a new company contributor joins the project. Therefore, using the Domain **Approval Criteria** requires less overhead because CCLA signatories and CCLA managers do not need to add and manage numerous employee email addresses.

**I contribute to an open source project, as an employee, for a company. Do I need to complete, sign, and submit a DocuSign document?**

Probably not. If your company's CCLA signatory has signed a Corporate CLA, and if you are included in the approved list under that company's CLA, then you simply confirm your association to the company during your code submission process.

If you are the first one from your company who has contributed to the project, then your company's CCLA signatory will need to sign a Corporate CLA as part of the EasyCLA process. Depending on the company, you might be an authorized CCLA signatory, but you will need to review with your company's leadership or legal counsel if you are not certain.

And if your company has already signed a Corporate CLA, but you are not yet on your company's approved list, then you must be included in the approved list by your company's CCLA manager as part of the EasyCLA process.

What should I do if my company is not listed while 

**If my project community has elected to use CLAs as a required step for contributions to their code, do I need to be authorized under a CLA for each project to which I contribute?**

Yes, provided that the project has a CLA.

* If you are contributing as an individualâ€”you must sign an Individual CLA for each project to which you contribute.
* If you are contributing as an employee of a company, your company's CCLA signatory must sign a Corporate CLA.

**Do I have to sign a CLA every time I contribute code?**

Signing a CLA for a project covers all code contributions to that project. You may, however, need to sign additional CLAs if you choose to contribute to other projects that require CLAs.

**What is the acceptable email format?**

A valid email address with an email prefix and an email domain, for example _abc@mail.com_ . 

The allowed characters for email prefix are letters \(a-z\), numbers, underscores, periods, and dashes, and an underscore, period, or dash must be followed by one or more letter or number, for example:  
_abc-d@mail.com/abc.def@mail.com/abc@mail.com/abc\_def@mail.com_

The allowed characters for email domain are letters, numbers, dashes, and the last portion of the domain must be at least two characters, for example: .com, .org, .cc
