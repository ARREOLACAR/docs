# Company Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Only ****corporate members, such as company owners, admins, and employees can view and manage company dashboard based on their permission level.
{% endhint %}

The LFX Company Dashboard makes it easier for corporate members to view Contributor License Agreement \(CLA\) details for their companies, sign CLA for an organization, manage other roles and activities based on their permission level. After you sign in to [LFX Company Dashboard](http://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/), you view the following sections:

* [Dashboard](dashboard.md)
* [Projects](projects/)
* [Organization Profile](manage-organization.md)

## What Role are You? <a id="what-role-are-you"></a>

How you interact with the LFX corporate console depends on your role. Corporate console supports the following roles in its workflow for EasyCLA:

* [Contributor](./#contributor)
* [Corporate CLA \(CCLA\) manager designee](./#corporate-cla-manager-designee)
* [Corporate CLA \(CCLA\) manager](./#corporate-cla-manager)

### Contributor <a id="contributor"></a>

You are a _contributor_ \(developer\) if you contribute code to GitHub or Gerrit projects. You can view company details after you sign in to corporate console.

While signing CLA for a company from GitHub or Gerrit workflow, you are navigated to corporate console to sign CLA. You become the initial CLA manager, also called CLA manager designee, and sign CLA for your company or designate someone else to sign CLA on behalf of the company. After CLA is signed, you become the CLA manager for your company. See [CLA Manager Designee / Initial CLA Manager](../easycla/corporate-cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/) and [CLA Managers](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/) for details about their roles.

### Corporate CLA Manager Designee

You are a _Corporate CLA Manager Designee_ \(CCLA manager designee\) if there are no existing CLA managers for a company, and  you are the first person to sign a CLA for a project.

You become a CLA manager designee:

* When you are authorized to [sign CLA](../easycla/corporate-cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/sign-corporate-cla-for-a-company.md) for a company as an initial CLA manager. After you sign CLA, you become the [CLA manager](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/). 
* When you receive an email informing you that you are identified as a CLA manager for a project. You [sign in ](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md)to corporate console,  [sign the CLA](../easycla/corporate-cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/sign-corporate-cla-from-invitation.md), and become CLA manager. **Note:** You must have an LFID to sign the CLA.

While completing the CLA signing process, you can designate someone else as CLA Signatory to sign the CLA on behalf of the company. After they sign the CLA, you become the [CLA manager](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/) for your company.

### Corporate CLA Manager <a id="corporate-cla-manager"></a>

You are a _Corporate CLA manager_ \(CCLA manager\) if you are authorized to manage the list of approved contributors under your companyâ€™s Corporate CLA policy. There can be one or more CLA managers for a company. With this responsibility, you use corporate console to:

* [Approve and Manage Contributors](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/approve-and-manage-contributors.md)
* [Add or Delete CLA Managers](../easycla/corporate-cla-managers/add-or-delete-cla-managers.md)
