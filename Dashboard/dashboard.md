# Dashboard

Once you login to the CommunityBridge, you are directed to the Dashboard. The Dashboard is a collaboration of all the [Foundations](https://github.com/communitybridge/communitybridge.github.io/blob/master/Foundation/foundation-discovery.md) and projects you are a member of. The following table decribes the various entities on the Foundation card:

|Organization|The number of members of your organization contributing to the Foundation|
|Contributors|The total number of contributors of a community or an organization|
|Commits|The total number of commits made by the members of the community or an organization|
