## CLA Managers and CLA Signatories

As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md):

#### **CCLA manager:** 

* [Add a Company to a Project](add-a-company-to-a-project.md).
* [Approve Contributors](approve-contributors.md)—each approved list applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

#### **CCLA signatory:**

* [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](sign-a-corporate-cla-on-behalf-of-the-company.md)
* [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md)—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* ​[Add or Delete CCLA Managers](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md)​
* ​[View Employee Acknowledgements](view-employee-acknowledgements.md)​
* ​[Edit the Company Name and Manager Details](edit-the-company-name-and-manager-details.md)​
