# CLA Managers, CLA Manager Designee, and CLA Signatories

## CLA Managers and CLA Signatories

As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md):

#### **CCLA manager:** 

* [Add a Company to a Project](../cla-managers/add-a-company-to-a-project.md).
* [Approve Contributors](../cla-managers/approve-contributors.md)—each approved list applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

#### **CCLA signatory:**

You are a CCLA signatory if you have the legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

* [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](sign-a-corporate-cla-on-behalf-of-the-company.md)
* [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md)

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* ​[View Employee Acknowledgements](view-employee-acknowledgements.md)​
