# Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the Company

As a CLA manager designee or CLA signatory, you must be authorized by your company to sign a Corporate CLA on its behalf. If you are a CCLA manager but not a CCLA signatory or CLA manager designee, you can request that the CCLA signatory or CLA manager designee sign the Corporate CLA.

**Do these steps:**

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md).  
The CLA Corporate Console appears and shows CLAs for your organization.

2. Navigate to a project for which you want to sign CLA, and click **Proceed with Signing**.

{% endhint %}

5. **Preparing CCLA** window appears. After CCLA preparation is completed, click **SIGN CCLA** on CCLA Ready for Signature window.
