# CLA Manager Designee and CLA Signatories

You are a CLA manager designee if you are identified to be a CLA manager for your company that has not signed a CLA yet. After you complete the process of signing CLA for your company, you become the CLA manager for your company. 

As the CCLA manager designee or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](../cla-managers/sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md):

* [Sign a corporate CLA on behalf of the company](sign-a-corporate-cla.md)
* [Review and sign a corporate CLA by request](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md)
