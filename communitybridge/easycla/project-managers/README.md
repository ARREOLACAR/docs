# Project Managers

Project managers manage a projectâ€™s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, repositories, and legal aspects, such as CLA. The Linux Foundation provides you administrator access for project\(s\), and you use the Project Control Center \(PCC\), also referred as Project Console, to manage projects.

As a project administrator, you do the following activities:

1. [Sign in to Project Control Center](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md)
2. [View CLA Details for a Project](view-cla-details.md)
3. [Add a New CLA Group](create-new-cla-group.md)
4. [Add or Remove Project from CLA Group](add-or-remove-a-project-from-cla-group.md)
5. [Add](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-github-organization) or [Disassociate](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#disassociate-github-organization) GitHub Organization
6. [Add](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-gerrit-organization) or [Disassociate](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#disassociate-gerrit-organization) Gerrit Organization 
7. [Add GitHub repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/add-or-remove-git-repositories-for-cla-monitoring.md) to enforce CLA monitoring
8. [Uninstall the EasyCLA Application](uninstall-the-easycla-application.md)

At any time, you can do other management tasks:

* [View Signed CLA Documents](view-and-manage-signed-clas-for-a-cla-group.md#view-signed-cla-document)
