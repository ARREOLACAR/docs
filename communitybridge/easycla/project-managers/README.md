# Project Managers

Project managers manage a project’s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, repositories, and legal aspects, such as CLA. Linux Foundation provides you administrator access for project\(s\), and you use the admin console to mange the project details. For details about Admin Console, see **PROVIDE A LINK**.

As a project administrator, you do the following activities:

1. Sign in to the Project Console
2. Configure the EasyCLA application.
3. ​[Add a CLA Group]().
4. ​[Add/Remove GitHub Repositories]() Or [Add/Delete Gerrit Instances](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/add-or-remove-gerrit-instances-from-cla-monitoring.md)

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* ​[View Current and Previous CLA PDFs]()​
* ​[Manage CLA Group Details](view-and-manage-signed-clas-for-a-cla-group.md)​
