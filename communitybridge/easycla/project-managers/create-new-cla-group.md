# Create New CLA Group

A CLA group defines:

* What CLA types your project requires for pull requests or push submissionsâ€”the agreement types are for corporate or individual CLAs
* What CLAs and their versions are used for the contributors
* What GitHub repositories, Gerrit instances, or both enforce CLA monitoring

As a project manager, you use the CLA Project Console to add and name a CLA group for your project.
