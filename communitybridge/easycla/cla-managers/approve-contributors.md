# Approve Contributors

You can approve contributors by adding their name to the Aprroved List. **Approved Lists** are lists of domain names, email addresses of individuals, GitHub usernames, or GitHub organization names who are authorized to contribute under a signed Corporate CLA.

As a CLA manager, you can:

* [Add Contributors](approve-contributors.md#add-contributor-s)
* [Edit a Contributor's Details](approve-contributors.md#edit-a-contributors-details)
* [Delete a Contributor's Details](approve-contributors.md#delete-a-contributors-details)

_Multiple CCLA managers cannot authorize/approve the same domain and sign a CCLA for the same company._
