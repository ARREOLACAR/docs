# Analyze Dashboard Analytics

INSIGHTS aggregates data and creates comprehensive dashboards from specific data sources. Dashboards include relevant visualizations that display analytic metrics and important data points. You can select and open a dashboard from drop-down lists corresponding to each data source.

* [Summary](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/summary.md)
* [Source Control](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/source-control/)
* [Chat Room](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/chat-room/)
* [Mailing List](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/mailing-list/)
* [Registry](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/registry/)
* [Documentation](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/documentation/)
* [Issue Management](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/project-management/)
* [CI/CD](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/ci-cd/)

A drop-down list is only available when a related data source is available.

**Follow these steps:**

1. From a project overview page, click a data source, for example Issue Management.
2. Select a **dashboard** from the drop-down list:  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/issue-management-drop-down.png) The selected dashboard appears and shows relevant visualizations.
