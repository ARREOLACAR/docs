# Request Access to Active Contributor Summary

Active Contributor Summary becomes available to you after you request and are granted access to your specific projects.

**Prerequisites:**  You must have a Single Sign-On \(SSO\) account. [Create an account](../../../sso/create-an-account.md) if you do not have an SSO account.

**Do these steps:**

1. Go to the [Linux Foundation Help Center](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4).
2. Select **Get Help with CommunityBridge INSIGHTS**. A ticket form appears.
3. In the ticket, request access to Active Contributor Summary. Include this information:
   * Your Linux Foundation username
   * A list of projects maintained by you in the Linux Foundation
4. Click **Create**.

You are notified when your access is granted. After you are granted access, use your SSO account credentials to sign in and [view](view-active-contributor-summary.md) Active Contributor Summary for the project that you are granted access to.
