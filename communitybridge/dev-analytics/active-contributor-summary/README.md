# Active Contributor Summary

**Note:** Only Project Administrators can view activity of contributors for their projects.

Active Contributor Summary displays an aggregated data for individual contributors. When contributors are relevant for Dev Analytics analysis, checking their activities is important. This helps you to analyze who contributes most and adds value to your project. It analyses and displays different identities, such as organization name, email address, number of commits, and many more data for each contributor to a project data source.

You must [request and be granted access](request-access-to-active-contributor-summary.md) to view Active Contributor Summary table.
