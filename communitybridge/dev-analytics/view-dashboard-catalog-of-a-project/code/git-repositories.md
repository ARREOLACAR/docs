The All Repositories dashboard represents a set of metrics that shows information about all the git repositories of the project.

## All Repositories &gt; **Overview** <a id="GitRepositories-GitRepositories&gt;Overview"></a>

**Summary** shows the number of Commits, Authors, and Repositories of the project.

**Commits Per Day** shows a bar graph that represents the number of commits per day for the project over time. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of commits for a date.
