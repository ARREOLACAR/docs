# Company Dashboard

Company dashboard is only for corporate employees.

The Linux Foundation provides a platform for corporate employees to view company details, such as projects and services the company is associated with, different user roles from the company, and so on. You can also manage other roles and activities based on your role in relation to a project and/or service. After you [sign in](../../sso/sign-in/) to LFX platform **\(LINK TO BE GIVEN AFTER RE-BRANDING\)**, you can view the following dashboards:
