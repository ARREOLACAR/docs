**Note:** Only ****corporate members, such as company owners, admins, and employees can view and manage company dashboard based on their roles for a project.
{% endhint %}

The Linux Foundation provides a platform for corporate members to view Corporate License Agreement \(CLA\) details for corporates, and to sign CLA for an organization. You can also manage other roles and activities based on your role in relation to a project. After you [sign in](../../sso/sign-in/) to LFX platform **\(WHICH LINK TO BE GIVEN HERE\)**, you can view the following dashboards:

* [Dashboard](dashboard.md)
* [Projects](projects/)
* [Organization Profile](manage-your-organization.md)

## What Role are You? \(Should we mention about other roles, like Company Owner, Company Admin, and so on\) <a id="what-role-are-you"></a>

How you interact with corporate console depends on your role. Corporate Console supports the following roles in its workflow for EasyCLA service:

* [Contributor](./#contributor)
* [Corporate CLA \(CCLA\) manager designee](./#corporate-cla-manager-designee)
* [Corporate CLA \(CCLA\) manager](./#corporate-cla-manager)

### Contributor <a id="contributor"></a>

You are a _contributor_ \(developer\) if you contribute code to GitHub or Gerrit projects. You can view your and company details after you sign in to corporate console.

While signing CLA for a company from GitHub or Gerrit workflow, you are navigated to corporate console to sign CLA. You become the initial CLA manager, also called CLA manager designee, and sign CLA after which you become the CLA manager for your company or you can designate someone else to sign CLA for your company. See [CLA Manager Designee / Initial CLA Manager](../easycla/cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/) and [CLA Managers](../easycla/cla-managers/) for details about their roles.

### Corporate CLA Manager Designee

You are a _Corporate CLA Manager Designee_ \(CCLA manager designee\) if there are no existing CLA managers for a company, and  you are the first person to sign a CLA for a project.

You become a CLA manager designee:

* When you are authorized to [sign CLA](../easycla/cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/sign-corporate-cla-for-a-company.md) for a company as an initial CLA manager. After you sign CLA, you become [CLA manager](../easycla/cla-managers/). 
* When you receive an email informing you that you are identified as a CLA manager for a project. You [sign in ](../easycla/cla-managers/sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md)to corporate console,  [sign the CLA](../easycla/cla-manager-designee-or-initial-cla-manager/sign-corporate-cla-from-invitation.md), and become CLA manager. You must have an LFID to sign the CLA.

You can designate someone else as CLA Signatory to sign CLA on behalf of the company. After he/she sign CLA, you become the [CLA manager](../easycla/cla-managers/) for your company.

### Corporate CLA Manager <a id="corporate-cla-manager"></a>

You are a _Corporate CLA manager_ \(CCLA manager\) if you are the person authorized to manage the list of approved contributors under your companyâ€™s Corporate CLA. There can be one or more CLA managers for a company. With this responsibility, you use corporate console to:
