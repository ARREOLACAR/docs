# Filtering Data

INSIGHTS aggregates data and creates comprehensive dashboards from specific data sources. Dashboards include relevant visualizations that display analytic metrics and important data points. You can select and open a dashboard from drop-down lists corresponding to each data source.

* [Summary](../viewing-dashboards/summary.md)
* [Source Control](../viewing-dashboards/source-control/)
* [Issue Management](../viewing-dashboards/project-management/)
* [Documentation](../viewing-dashboards/documentation/)
* [Chat Room](../viewing-dashboards/chat-room/)
* [Mailing List](../viewing-dashboards/mailing-list/)
* [CI/CD](../viewing-dashboards/ci-cd/)
* [Registry](../viewing-dashboards/registry/)
* [Active Contributors](../viewing-dashboards/active-contributors/)

A drop-down list is only available when a related data source is available.

**Follow these steps:**

1. From a project overview page, click a data source, for example Source Control.
2. Select a **dashboard** from the drop-down list: The selected dashboard appears and shows relevant visualizations.
