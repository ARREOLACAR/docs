# Filtering Data

INSIGHTS aggregates data and creates comprehensive dashboards from specific data sources. Dashboards include relevant visualizations that display analytic metrics and important data points. You can select and open a dashboard from drop-down lists corresponding to each data source.

* [Summary](../viewing-dashboards/summary.md)
* [Source Control](../viewing-dashboards/source-control/)
* [Issue Management](../viewing-dashboards/project-management/)
* [Documentation](../viewing-dashboards/documentation/)
* [Chat Room](../viewing-dashboards/chat-room/)

* [CI/CD](../viewing-dashboards/ci-cd/)
* [Registry](../viewing-dashboards/registry/)
* [Active Contributors](../viewing-dashboards/community-leader-board/)

A drop-down list is only available when a related data source is available.

**Follow these steps:**

1. From a project overview page, click a data source, for example Source Control.

2. Select a **dashboard** from the drop-down list:  
The selected dashboard appears and shows relevant visualizations.

3. On a selected dashboard, navigate to the **Filter** visualization, select values from the drop-down lists, and click **Apply Changes** to filter the dashboard data.

* **Apply changes:** Filters the dashboard as per selected values
* **Cancel changes**: If there are filter values selected before, it shows the previously selected filter values in the respective drop-down fields. If there are no filter values selected before, it cancels the present values.
* **Clear from:** It clears all the filter values, and lets you add new values in the respective drop-down fields.
