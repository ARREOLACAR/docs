# Edit Profile Personal Details

Edit a profile to add or update contributor information. For example, if you want a proper noun to appear in names in dashboards and not a contributor username, you can edit the Name field to the proper nouns, for example: `John Smith` rather than `j_smith`. In another example, you can mark a profile as a bot to indicate that the activity may not be worth counting. By doing so, contributions for this profile will not counted in dashboards.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project** of interest.

2. Click **Affiliation Management**.

3. Select a profile from the **Top Unaffiliated Contributors** list or [search for a profile](find-a-profile.md) that you want to edit.
