# Insights FAQs

## How does CommunityBridge Insights work?

CommunityBridge Insights collects data for a project, segregates them to different data sources, such as source control for code related data, issue management for issues statuses, documentation for confluence and wiki pages, CI/CD for Jenkins, and so on. It represents these data on different visualization dashboards, such as graphs, charts, and tables.

## Who can see CommunityBridge Insights reports?

Anyone can see reports for projects that are on CommunityBridge. However, only project maintainers can see information related to affiliation management, and email ids of contributors.

## How does CommunityBridge Insights help?

It helps open source project maintainers monitor their project activity, total and individual contribution towards the project, active contributor lists, any unaffiliated contributors, and so on. This helps maintainers to solve problems effectively such as coding activity, code review backlog, performance, bottleneck identification, issue resolution, and so on.

## Does CommunityBridge Insights automatically create visualization reports?

Yes, if your project is set up on Linux Foundations's SFDC \(Sales Force Dot Com\) database, then CommunityBridge Insights automatically collects and visualizes data on graphs, charts, tables, and other customized dashboards.

## How are unaffiliated contributions calculated?

Unaffiliated contributions are not counted under any organization, and are grouped as **Unknown**. CommunityBridge highly recommends to affiliate top contributors of your project.

## Is affiliation data linked to one project?

No, affiliation data is linked to profiles, and profiles are visible across all the projects that they are part of. So, affiliation data for profiles are also visible across projects that they are part of.

## How are contributions calculated?

CommunityBridge Insight calculates contribution data based on commit hash. So, if a changeset or pull request is created to tow different branches with same commit hash identification number, Insight counts it as a single contribution, eliminating chance of duplication.
