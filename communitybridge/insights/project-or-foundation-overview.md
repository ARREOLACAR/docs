# Project or Foundation Overview

CommunityBridge Insights shows project and foundation cards, in alphabetical order, that show relevant data associated with the project or foundation.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Open [https://lfanalytics.io](https://lfanalytics.io/). The Projects page appears and lists the foundations and projects.
2. Navigate to a project or foundation card:
   * [Project Overview](project-or-foundation-overview.md#project-overview)
   * [Foundation Overview](project-or-foundation-overview.md#foundation-overview)
3. Click a standalone project or a project from foundation level. Dashboards appear based on what data is available for a project.
4. By default, [Summary](viewing-dashboards/summary.md) dashboard appears. Go to each dashboard. These dashboards are collection of charts and graphs that show you the metrics. The overview dashboards let you monitor many metrics at once, so you can check the health of your projects and see how the contribution is. For overview of individual data sources, see [Viewing Dashboards](viewing-dashboards/).
5. Use optional actions:
   * [Select Time Range](filtering-data/select-time-range.md)
   * Eliminate data by clicking the corresponding legend **caption** \(in this example **Contributors\)**. Click the **caption** again to include the data. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/18088257.png)
