# CommunityBridge Insights

CommunityBridge Insights is a centralized platform that collects and visualizes data to let you monitor and analyze your open source projects. Insights adds value across the Linux Foundation organization by providing objective data that analyzes the project's data sources and presents them in graphs on customized dashboards. Dashboards represent an overview of the development status of your teams, and the performance and activities of a project. You can analyze the data to solve problems effectively such as coding activity, code review backlog, performance, bottleneck identification, and issue resolution.
