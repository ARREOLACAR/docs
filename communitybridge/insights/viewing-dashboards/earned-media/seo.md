# SEO

Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) is a website's domain authority that predicts how competitive it will be in Google search page rankings. Depending upon the number of visitors to project's website, the impact is determined. This analysis helps project administrators decide how well they can build the SEO friendly site to attract more unique users.

**SEO Impact** displays a scale of 1 to 100 that shows the impact of a project's website in google search page rankings.

**Number of Mentions** shows how many times a project related article or blog is mentioned over different media types based on project's search term \(keyword\). One article/blog is equal to one mention even if the search terms are used more than once in the article/blog.
