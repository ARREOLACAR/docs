# Community Leader Board

When contributors are relevant for INSIGHTS analysis, checking their activities is important. This helps you to analyze who contributes most and adds value to your project. CommunityBridge INSIGHTS analyses and displays different identities, such as organization name, email address, number of commits, and many more data for each contributor to a project data source. 

Active Contributors shows a table and lets you download the table data to a CSV file. For details, see [Active Community Leaderboard](active-community-leaderboard.md).
