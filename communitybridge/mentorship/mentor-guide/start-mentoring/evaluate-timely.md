# Mentee Evaluations

Mentee evaluations are conducted three or four times throughout the duration of the mentorship project in order to provide mentees with feedback on their progress.You may also chose to have 1:1 check-ins, virtual meetings with your mentees or written evaluations. 

Only after receiving a satisfactory evaluation, mentees can submit an Expensify report to receive a stipends.  

**Note:** Mentees are also asked to share their experience, provide feedback and suggestions at the end of the mentorship so that Linux Foundation can make improvements to program.   
Keep in mind that information about your mentoring is reflected in their blogs.
