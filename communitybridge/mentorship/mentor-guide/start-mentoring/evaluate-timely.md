# Mentee Evaluations

Mentee evaluations are conducted three or four times throughout the duration of the mentorship project in order to provide mentees with feedback on their progress. Depending on your project, you may also chose to have a 1:1 check-in, virtual meetings with your mentees.  Only after receiving a satisfactory evaluation, mentees can submit an Expensify report to receive a stipends.  

**Note:** Mentees are also asked to share their experience, provide feedback and suggestion at the end of the program so that Linux Foundation can make improvements for future programs. Keep in mind that your mentoring during the program is reflected in their blogs.
