# Mentee Evaluations

Mentee evaluations are conducted three or four times throughout the duration of the mentorship project in order to provide mentees with feedback on their progress.You may choose to have 1:1 check-ins, written evaluations, or virtual meetings with your mentees.

Only after receiving a satisfactory evaluation, mentees can submit an Expensify report to receive stipends.  

**Note:** Mentees are also asked to share their experience, provide feedback and suggestions at the end of their mentorship so that Linux Foundation can make improvements to program.
