# Manage Your Tasks

As a mentee, you receive task assignments from your mentor. When your mentor approves the completion of all your tasks, you graduate. Your mentorship is intended to help you begin contributing to an open source project. Therefore, contribute all your work to the project \(such as patches, documentation, tests, and so on\) according to its open source licensing and contribution policies.

**Follow these steps:**

1. [Sign in](../../../sso/sign-in/) to [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://people.communitybridge.org/).
2. Navigate to **My Account &gt;** **My Tasks** to view your task assignments.
3. Under **Tasks Assigned To Me**, upload files for required tasks, complete other tasks, and change status:

   * **Pending:** You are yet to complete the task.
   * **In Progress:** Change the status to In Progress when you are working on it. Your project maintainer/mentor gets notified about the status.
   * **Submitted:** You have completed the task.

   You can view or download an uploaded file for a task by clicking the respective icons beside a task

You can sort values from **Task Status** and **Sorting Order** drop-down lists.

Complete all your tasks to graduate from the Mentorship program. Your mentor determines whether you have satisfactorily completed each task. If you and your mentor disagree about whether you have completed the tasks, reach out to the project administrator to discuss it. You are listed as a graduate for that project on CommunityBridge. If your mentorship includes a stipend and you are eligible for it, [submit a claim](../../crowd-funding/get-reimbursed.md) for it \(projects may have varying milestones and schedules for payments of stipends\).
