# Mentorship

The Linux Foundation mentorship programs enable projects to grow their communities by cultivating mentoring relationships with talented and committed developers. By offering paid mentorships, projects are able to provide mentees with opportunities to learn from experienced open source developers and to get internship and job opportunity referrals with employers upon graduation.

CommunityBridge Mentorship platform was created by the Linux Foundation to make it easy for projects to administer their mentorship programs by connecting mentorship candidates with projects and mentors.

## How to Participate <a id="CommunityBridgeMentorship-HowtoParticipate"></a>

**Note:** You need to create a [Single Sign-On \(SSO\) account](../../sso/create-an-account.md) or [sign in](../../sso/sign-in/) to [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://people.communitybridge.org/) platform to participate in the Mentorship programs. 

You can participate in Mentorship program as a project administrator, a mentor or a mentee. 

[**Project administrator**](administrators/): As a project administrator, you can [enroll a project](administrators/enroll-your-project/) so that it is available in the Mentorship program. By enrolling your project, you can expand the size and diversity of the community.

[**Mentor**](mentors/): Mentors are project contributors who want to donate their time to mentor individuals. You can [create a mentor profile](mentors/become-a-mentor/create-a-mentor-profile.md) to become a mentor for participants/mentees in the open source projects.

[**Mentee**](mentees/): You can apply to [become a mentee](mentees/become-a-mentee/) if you are interested in learning open source technology and want to advance  your career. By applying as a mentee, you have the opportunity to engage in an open source project under the guidance of someone experienced in the project and community.

## What is a Mentorship Stipend? <a id="CommunityBridgeMentorship-WhatisaMentorshipStipend?"></a>

A [stipend](mentee-stipends/) is a periodic payment for your participation as a mentee in the Mentorship program. A stipend and other incentives support and encourage mentees to participate. Funding for stipends and other perks is determined solely by each project. After you complete the prerequisite qualifications and are accepted to the program, you become eligible to receive a stipend.
