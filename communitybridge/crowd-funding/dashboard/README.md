## Security Audits \(OSTIF\)

**Security Audits \(OSTF\)** lists all the projects that are applied for security audit to [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund](https://ostif.org/the-ostif-mission/) \(OSTIF\). Following is the process followed by OSTIF for security audit:

1. OSTIF hires professional auditors and organizes communication between application developers and the audit team.
2. Developers provide code to auditors to evaluate for vulnerabilities.
3. Auditors supply the developers with the results of the evaluation and assist with fixing/strengthening the code to make the software strong and trustworthy.
4. The updated code is released to the public and OSTIF begins providing a bug bounty. This allows people from all over the world to have an opportunity to evaluate the code for themselves and find vulnerabilities for rewards.
5. The developers continue to upgrade and strengthen the software before starting the next audit.
