* **If the user, being added, doesn't have LFID:** A request is sent to the user's email address with the link to create an LFID. After the user creates an LFID, you must [add](how-to-add-or-delete-a-cla-manager.md#to-add-a-cla-manager) the user as a CLA manager.  ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/request-sent-to-add-a-cla-manager.png)
