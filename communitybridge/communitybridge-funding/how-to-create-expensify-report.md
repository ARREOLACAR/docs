# How to Create Expensify Report

You can create an Expensify report by referring to either of the following method:

* Create the report before you incur expense and add the expenses as they arise. Or, 
* Consolidate all your expenses from your trip/event/onboarding and apply them to the report. 

#### To create a report:

1. Under you account, select **Reports** tab.
