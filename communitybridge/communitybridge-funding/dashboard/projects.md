# Projects

Projects page indicates how active a project is in the open source community. This information can help you decide what particular open source project to participate in or fund. You can also learn about the financial aspects of a project, view how funds are distributed and what the funding goals are. CommunityBridge Funding maintains and displays a transparent ledger of incoming funds \(backer and sponsor transactions\) and outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each project. The Financial tab of a project page lists all these transactions with details so that the entire community can view receipts of expenses.

**To view project details:**

1. Open [CommunityBridge Funding](https://funding.communitybridge.org/).
2. From **Projects** tab, Click a **project** of interest. The landing page shows overview of the project.
3. Browse Dashboard for information. Click the **Financial** tab to see transaction details. **Note:** The Home screen shows the overview of the project.
