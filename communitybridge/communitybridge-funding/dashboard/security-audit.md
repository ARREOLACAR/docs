# Security Audit

Security Audit page displays the projects that are currently enrolled for security audit done by [OSTIF.](https://ostif.org/the-ostif-mission/) This information can help you decide what particular open source project to participate in or fund. You can also learn about the financial aspects of a project, how expenses are distributed, and so on. CommunityBridge Funding maintains and displays a transparent ledger of incoming funds \(backer and sponsor transactions\) and outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each project that is enrolled for security audit. The Financial tab of a project page lists all these transactions with details so that the entire community can view receipts of expenses.

**To view details:**

1. Open [CommunityBridge Funding](https://funding.communitybridge.org/).
2. From **Security Audits \(OSTIF\)** tab, Click a **project** of interest. The landing page shows overview of the project.
3. Browse Dashboard for information. Click the **Financial** tab to see transaction details. **Note:** The Home screen shows the overview of the project.
