# Supported Data Sources

Data sources are the primary locations or remote servers where data are stored. LFX Insights accesses such data sources, collects data for a project, segregates them to different sections, such as source control for code related data, issue management for issues statuses, documentation for confluence and wiki pages, CI/CD for Jenkins, and so on. 

Insights supports the following data sources based on their categories:

#### Source Control Systems

Following are the various source control system data sources currently supported by Insights:

* Git
* GitHub
* Gerrit

#### Documentation

Insights supports Confluence for tracking and visualizing project's documentation. For details, see [Confluence](view-project-dashboard/ecosystem-trends/documentation/confluence.md).

#### Chat Room

Insights supports chat room platforms, such as [Slack](view-project-dashboard/ecosystem-trends/chat-room/slack.md) and [Rocket Chat](view-project-dashboard/ecosystem-trends/chat-room/rocket-chat.md) to analyze the project related communication among project members.

#### Issue Tracking Systems

Following are the various issue tracking system data sources currently supported by Insights:

* [GitHub](view-project-dashboard/technical-trends/project-management/github-issues.md)
* [Bugzilla](view-project-dashboard/technical-trends/project-management/bugzilla.md)
* [Jira](view-project-dashboard/technical-trends/project-management/jira.md)

#### Build Systems

Currently, Insights supports [Jenkins](view-project-dashboard/technical-trends/ci-cd/jenkins.md) as one of the popular build system data sources. The Linux Foundation is releasing soon the support for some more popular build system data sources, such as CircleCI, Travis CI, Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions, to name a few, with Insights tool.
