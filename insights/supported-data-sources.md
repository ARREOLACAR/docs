# Supported Data Sources

Data sources are the collaboration tools or the remote servers that are used to drive the development of a project. LFX Insights accesses such data sources, collects data for a project, segregates them to different sections, such as source control for code related data, issue management for issues statuses, documentation for confluence and wiki pages, CI/CD for Jenkins, and so on.
