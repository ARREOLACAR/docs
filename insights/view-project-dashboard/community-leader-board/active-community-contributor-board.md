# Active Community Contributor board

Active Community Contributor board displays an aggregated data of individual contributors for three major data sourcesâ€”Code based \(Git and Gerrit\), Issue Tracker \(Jira, GitHub Issues, and Bugzilla\), and Wiki page \(confluence\). Columns, such as Commits, LOC Added, LOC Modified, and LOC Deleted provide data of git repositories.

* By default, data is displayed for **Code** data source. Select other data sources to view related data.
* **Search within Contributor Board** lets you quickly search for contributor's details with author name and organization name. As an administrator for a project, you can also search details with email addresses of contributors of the project.
* You can also quickly search a page by entering the age number in the **Page** number filed at the bottom right corner.
* Click **Export** to download the table data to a `.csv` file.
* The Active Community Leaderboard Table lets you sort by values except Author Name, Organization name, and Email Id of contributors.
