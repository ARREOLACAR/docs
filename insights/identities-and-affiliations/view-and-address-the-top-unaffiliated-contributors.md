# View and Address the Top Unaffiliated Contributors

Top Unaffiliated Contributors list the top-ten respective items with the greatest numbers of contributions that have no affiliation. Addressing missing affiliations produces meaningful statistics about your contributors because individual contributions are not underestimated. Different roles \(examples: organization representatives, individual contributors, or community managers\) might recognize that contribution counts seem underestimated or inaccurate. These roles can take action by addressing missing affiliations.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project** of interest on the home page.
2. Click **Affiliation Management**.

In Top Unaffiliated Contributors, look for a contributor who belongs to your project community. Missing affiliations for this contributor's profile might cause inaccurate counts for your project statistics.

**Do these steps:**

1. Under **Top Unaffiliated Contributors**, click the name of the contributor or hover mouse over Commits number for the contributor of interest and click **search**.  
**Note:** The unique identity of the profile is displayed with all the details, such as Name, Email, Affiliations, Bot, Country, Last Modified On, and \# specifying the number of identities associated with the person.

* Searching a contributor by clicking his/her name under Top Unaffiliated Contributors, shows the unique identity of the contributor's profile.
* Searching a contributor by entering his/her name in the **Search Profiles** field, shows all the identities associated with the profile.
{% endhint %}

2. Click the name under **Contributor** column to see identities associated with the profile.

3. Continue to Step 5 of [Merge or Un-merge an Identity Profile](merge-or-un-merge-an-identity-profile.md).

4. Select **Home** and scan Top Unaffiliated Contributors.  
The contributor name is no longer listed because you have addressed the missing affiliations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to a lag in the list refresh, names can remain in a Top Unaffiliated list even after you have addressed the missing affiliation. Check the list again later.
