# Identities and Affiliations

{% hint style="info" %}
* Only **Project Administrators** can manage affiliations of contributors for their projects.
* Contributors who are not affiliated with any organization are counted as Unknown for Insight dashboard visualizations at organization level contribution.
{% endhint %}

As a project manager, you can manage different identities, such as email address and username of each contributor for a project, and affiliate their identities with the organizations they are associated with. If a profile does not have an affiliation with an identity or organization, its contributions are not counted in various Insights dashboards. To address this problem, Affiliation Management manages contributor identities including capabilities for merging identities and other data related to them such as affiliation to organizations. [Affiliation Management identifies missing affiliations and helps you address them too.](view-and-address-the-top-unaffiliated-contributors.md)

[You must request and be granted access to edit affiliations.](request-access-to-affiliation-management.md)
