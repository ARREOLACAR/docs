# Foundadtion

Foundations are a group of individual standalone projects. For example, Kubernetes is a standalone project and is a member of the CNCF Foundation \(Cloud Native Computing Foundation\).

This page shows a list of Foundations and the projects you are a member of. Each Foundation card summarizes information such as total number of members and contributors. The Foundations can be sorted on the basis of Category ![Category](../.gitbook/assets/category.png) and time of access \(Recent/Old/New\)![Filter by](../.gitbook/assets/filter_by.png). You can also search a Foundation using the Search ![Search](../.gitbook/assets/search_foundation.png) option. If you click **Learn More** on the project mini-card you will be directed to the [Project Details](https://github.com/communitybridge/communitybridge.github.io/blob/master/Foundation/project_details.md) page.

The following table decribes the various entities on the Foundation card:

| Entity | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Color on the top of the Foundation card | The level of membership, for example, gold, silver, bronze |
| Community | The size of the community |
| Organization | The number of members of your organization contributing to the Foundation |
| Contributors | The total number of contributors of a community or an organization |
| Commits | The total number of commits made by the members of the community or an organization |
